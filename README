ad2ga.py: script to convert autodif absolute observations to ga .obs file
=========================================================================
* if you don't know what version to use, use the one with the latest version number
    * don't use ad2ga.py as that is what I use to experiment with
* i think everytime any of the script are saved from windows, it resets the unix permisions on the file
    *

usage
-----
geomagr@rhe-geomag-prod01.prod.lan:>$GMProj/u/autodif/ad2ga-0.9.1.py -h
usage: ad2ga-0.9.1.py [-h] [-o OUT_FN] in_fn

Convert Autodif observations file to extract.bat/run.bat file

positional arguments:
  in_fn       Autodif input file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -o OUT_FN   Output to this file

changes
-------
* 0.9
	* first version
    * 0.9.1
        * changed hz1 and hz2 calulation with input from AML, though still not 100% confirmed
    * 0.9.2
        * fixed issue with " (second symbol) not being printed for declination and inclination readings
    * 0.9.3
        * add second information to 'begin abs' (currently only to the minute)
        * make the angle readings line up (mark and hz readings need to be shifted to right to align with other readings)
        * add in support for unsuccessful mark readings
            * previous versions only used obs that had 'RECTIME {date} {time} COMPLETE' (successful mark reading)
            * 'RecTime {} {} MAGNETIC' (unsuccessful mark reading) observations will use the last successul mark reading
                * will notify to stderr
                * will be commented in ga .obs output
        * observer name changed to gsb to rmi (royal met. inst.)
        * 0.9.3.1
            * fixed issue with angles with 60 seconds (and probably 60 minutes and 360 degrees) being printed out
            * fixed with dd2dms_shim function
                * needs more testing (tests under definition of function)
    * 0.9.4
        * pull in 1 one minute of PPM data (pier F)
        * implemented by creating temp file from machview (rhe version to use is /opt/gm/machview)
            * need to be careful with options (uses windows style '/', but space needed for linux)
        * 0.9.4.1
            * fixed issue with horizontal calculation (before was only using 2 declinations instead of 4)
        * 0.9.4.1
            * --np to --nppm (bit more clearer)
            * --hzdd to show inclination horizontals in decimal degrees (comment)
            * line numbers 1-indexed
            * missing mark reading comment changed so easier regex
