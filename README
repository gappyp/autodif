ad2ga.py: script to convert autodif absolute observations to ga .obs file
=========================================================================
* if you don't know what version to use, use the one with the latest version number
    * don't use ad2ga.py as that is what I use to experiment with
* i think everytime any of the script are saved from windows, it resets the unix permisions on the file
    *
